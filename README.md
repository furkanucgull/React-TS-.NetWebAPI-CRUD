# Full Stack Movie Website

## Description

This project is a full-stack movie website that is currently under development. The website will feature user registration, movie management (add, edit, delete), and dynamic content updates. This project aims to demonstrate my ability to create robust and scalable web applications using modern technologies for both frontend and backend development.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: .NET Core Web API (.NET 8), Entity Framework Core
- **Routing**: React Router
- **HTTP Requests**: Axios
- **Database**: SQL Server

## Features

- **User Authentication and Registration:** Allows users to register and log in (in development).
- **CRUD Operations for Movie Management:** Create, read, update, and delete movies.
- **Responsive UI Design:** Built with TailwindCSS for a modern, responsive design.
- **RESTful API Integration:** Seamless communication between frontend and backend.
- **Secure Backend Architecture:** Powered by .NET Core Web API and Entity Framework Core.
- **Dummy Data Handling:** Displays dummy data if no movies are available in the database or if data retrieval fails.
